  This performs the SELECT procedure as explained in ISO 14443A, this determines the UID of the card, if multiple cards
  are present, a collision will occur, which is handled according to the norm. This collision handling is explained
  quite complex in the norm, but conceptually it is not all that complex:

    - The cascade level can be seen as a prefix to ensure both the PICC and PCD are working on identifying the same
      part of the UID.
    - The entire anti-collision scheme is more of a binary search, the PICC sends the CASCADE level prefix, then the
      NVB byte, this field determines how many bits of the UID will follow, this allows the PICC's to listen to this
      and respond if their UID's match these first bits with the UID that is transmitted. After this all PICC's (that
      have matched the UID bits already sent) respond with the remainder of their UIDS. This results in either a
      complete UID, or in case two PICC's share a few bits but then differ a bit, a collision occurs on this bit. This
      collision is detected by the PCD, at which point it can chose either to pursue the PICC(s) that has a 0b1 at that
      position, or pursue the 0b0 at that position. The ISO norm states: A typical implementation adds a (1)b.
      I use the bit value that's in the pointer at the same position as the collision, or atleast for the first cascade
      level that works, after that it's off by a byte because of the cascade tag, see the actual implementation.

  \param [out] uid: The UID of the card will be stored into this array. This array is also used to determine the choice
                    between an 0b1 or 0b0 when a collision occurs. The bit that's in `uid` at the collision position is
                    selected.
  \param [out] sak: The last SAK byte received during the SELECT procedure is placed here, this often holds information

/*! \brief An example to read the first four blocks.

  Reading from a MIFARE card has the following steps, which are implemented in this function.

  Load the correct register settings with:
    \code
      mfrc630_AN1102_recommended_registers(MFRC630_PROTO_ISO14443A_106_MILLER_MANCHESTER);
    \endcode

  The normal procedure to read a card would be to wake them up using:
    \code
      mfrc630_iso14443a_REQA();
    \endcode

  If there is a response, start the SELECT procedure with 
    \code
      uint8_t uid_len = mfrc630_iso14443a_select(uid, &sak);
    \endcode

  If uid_len is nonzero, we have found a card and UID. We can attempt to
  authenticate with it, for example with the default key:
    
    \code
      uint8_t FFkey[6] = {0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF};
      mfrc630_cmd_load_key(FFkey); // load into the key buffer
    \endcode

  Then attempt to authenticate block 0 using this FFkey as KEY_A type:
    \code
      mfrc630_MF_auth(uid, MFRC630_MF_AUTH_KEY_A, 0)
    \endcode

  Finally, if that succeeds, we may use:
    \code
      len = mfrc630_MF_read_block(0, readbuf)
    \endcode

  To read block 0 from the card. After which we call:
    \code
      mfrc630_MF_deauth()
    \endcode
  To disable the currently enabled encryption process.
